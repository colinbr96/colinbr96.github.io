	"brief_description": "With a sense of dissatisfaction by the selection of themes available on <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore\" target=\"_blank\">Googleâ€™s Chrome Web Store</a>, I decided to just make my own. Smooth Gray will theme your Chrome with a remarkably simple office look. The grayscale palette is great for staying focused on actual web content, instead of the browser itself. This theme is fantastic and timeless.",
	"reflection": "Smooth Gray was created using the <a href=\"https://www.themebeta.com/chrome-theme-creator-online.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome Theme Creator</a> online tool. I simply generated the necessary images using Adobe Fireworks, uploaded them, and tweaked the details to my liking. I have considered creating variants of the theme, but the original is still timeless. By maintaining this page and the Smooth Gray download, I hope that others get a chance to enjoy the theme as well.",
